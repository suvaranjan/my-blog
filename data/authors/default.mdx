I am a dedicated full-stack developer with over three years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications. My expertise spans the entire stack, from front-end to back-end development.

I have a strong command of modern technologies, including Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces. I’m skilled in developing robust server-side applications using Node.js, Express, and Prisma, ensuring efficient data handling and seamless integration with various front-end frameworks.

In addition to these core technologies, I have extensive experience working with both relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases. My projects emphasize clean code, efficient data structures, and well-organized architecture, allowing for easy scaling and maintainability. I’m passionate about staying current with the latest developments in web technologies and enjoy building applications that offer users a smooth and intuitive experience.
